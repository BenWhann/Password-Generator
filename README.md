# <Project-Portfolio>

## Description

This is a random password generator. Upon the click of a button, it gives users the ability to choose the length of the password, and what characters they would like to be included in their password. It then generates a random string of characters and abides by the users chosen parameters. I worked on this project to further my understanding of JavaScript. 

## Installation

All you need to do is pull the code down from the repository, open it in your IDE of choice, and run it in a browser.

## Usage

This is meant to give users a secure password with the click of a button.

## Credits

I learned pretty much everything from the head instructor and the TA's from the bootcamp I am 
currently enrolled in. I also bounced some ideas off of a friend of mine while working on this project, so shoutout to my man Isiah. I also did not create the HTML or CSS for this project. That was given from class as starter code. I only created the JavaScript.
